# Python-Hash-Cracker
Extremely Fast Python Hash Cracker with GUI!!! This tool can try 300,000 passwords a second(faster than Cain-www.oxid.it). 
This tool comes in a compiled executable windows gui format and a Win/OS X/Linux/iOS comandline format.(iOS must be jailbroken with python 2.7 installed from my repo(www.starwarsfan2099.x10host.com/repo).

#Usage:
#Command Line
Info: ./Hash-Cracker.py -i

Cracking: ./Hash-Cracker.py -h (hash) -t (type) -w (wordlist)

Cracking verbosely: ./Hash-Cracker.py -h (hash) -t (type) -w (wordlist) -v

Crack with numbers bruteforce: ./Hash-Cracker.py -h (hash) -t (type) -n

All Options:

-h: Hash

-t: Type

-w: Wordlist

-n: Numbers Bruteforce

-v: Verbose
#GUI
Double click the executable! From there you can hit File:Import:Hash to enter a hash, File:Import:Hash from file to import a hash from a file, File:Import:Wordlist to select a wordlist, select the type and crack on the main screen. Options include numbers bruteforce and export the cracked hash with the password to a file called hash.txt.


Known GUI problems: When cracking the GUI will freeze and not respond, but it is still running!!! You just have to wait until its cracked or the wordlist ends.
